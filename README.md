# Basic Usage Instructions

jqPlot requires jQuery (1.4+ required for certain features). jQuery 1.9.1 is included in the distribution.

To use jqPlot, include jQuery, the jqPlot jQuery plugin, the jqPlot css file and optionally the excanvas script to support IE version prior to IE 9 in your web page:

```
<!--[if lt IE 9]><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="excanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="jquery.jqplot.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jquery.jqplot.css" />
```
