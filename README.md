# Basic Usage Instructions:

jqPlot requires jQuery (1.4+ required for certain features). jQuery 1.9.1 is included in the distribution.  To use jqPlot, include jQuery, the jqPlot jQuery plugin, the jqPlot css file and optionally the excanvas script to support IE version prior to IE 9 in your web page:

    <!--[if lt IE 9]><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="excanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="jquery.jqplot.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jquery.jqplot.css" />

For more information, see the [documentation](http://www.jqplot.com/docs) and [examples](http://www.jqplot.com/examples).

# Building from source:

If you've cloned the repository, you can build a distribution from source.
You need to have ant (http://ant.apache.org) installed.  You can simply 
type "ant" from the jqplot directory to build the default "all" target.  
There are 6 pertinent targets: clean, dist, min, docs, compress and all.  Use:

> ant -p

to get a description of the various build targets.
